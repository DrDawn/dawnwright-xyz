   # Testing My Digital Garden

   This is my first note published from my local repository to dawnwright.xyz.

   If you can read this on the website, the publishing workflow is working correctly.

   ## Next Steps
   - Copy content from Obsidian vault
   - Customize site appearance  
   - Set up efficient publishing routine
